## What are we creating

- Check the existent users page and apply this changes:
  - Update this UI to work based on the user type defined in the types package (check the table columns, check the modals)
  - Update the backend url we're pointing the requests in this page. It should use /admin/users and related.

## 2nd step

- Let's remove the "create user" feature entirely. It has some conflicts with the business logic.
- Let's keep the "update user" feature, but let's only allow the admin to update its plan or role. The rest remains the same.
